# FlappyBirdGame
This project is a Java-based recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game. The goal was to develop a game that simulates realistic bird motion and includes features like collision detection and game state management. I used Java Swing to create the graphical user interface, which handles player interactions and renders the game components.
